I worked with two of my classmates, Adam and Rich. We swicthed roles as driver and nagvigator.
At first, Rich was driver, then me and then Adam. When Rich was the driver, me and Adam were navigator one at a time and then guide him for initial formatting including header, title and skeleton of the project and some of the images. 

Then, we continued on adding other stuffs. We did not use js file for it even though I thought I might use it initially.
